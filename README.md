##  How It Works

The system uses **three cooperative agents** via [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI):

1. **CV Agent** – Parses structured data from the candidate’s CV
2. **Role Agent** – Extracts technical requirements from the job title/description
3. **Question Agent** – Synthesizes role-specific interview questions using the data from the above agents

Agents share information via tasks, and collaborate to generate concise and targeted interview questions.
